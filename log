### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

Today's Progress: I've started FreeCodeCamp personal portfolio project.

it was a struggle, first coudln't start bootstrap on code.io and then the drop down wasn't working. Spent the whole one hour trying to correct this and so far have only fixed the boot strap issue. The drop down is still not working.
