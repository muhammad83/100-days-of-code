### Day 2: Januray 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: started my portfolio page of free code camp.

### Day 3: Januray 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: continued with the my portfolio page of free code camp.

**Thoughts** what a day! spent most of the day to figure out why the drop down was not working. Only to discover the same logic doesn't apply on code pen. How annoying. I am uploading my try files here for future reference.
