### Day 3: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: continued with the my portfolio page of free code camp.

**Thoughts** what a day! spent most of the day to figure out why the drop down was not working. Only to discover the same logic doesn't apply on code pen. How annoying. I am uploading my try files here for future reference.

### Day 5: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: continued with the my portfolio page of free code camp. more progress on content and layout 

**Thoughts** Really slow speed. I feel last 5 days of work could have been done in about 1 hour tops, but as I am new I will not let this demoralize me into giving this up all together.

### Day 7: January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: continued with the my portfolio page of free code camp. fixed the menu selection and highlighting the sections when going up or down

**Thoughts** So I think I am done. Just need to make it work on mobile which the sample site doesn't seem to be working either. also need to add the animation scroll. Good day I would say even though the progress is still slow but I am learning a lot.

### Day 8: January 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: continued with the my portfolio page of free code camp. Added the animated scrolling using javascript

**Thoughts** Got the javascript scrolling to work in about 10 15 mins spent the remaining time trying to figure out why the menu is not working on mobile, tried gitter messenger for help but no joy. Will try and figure this out tomorrow

### Day 9: January 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: finished the personal portfolio website for freecodecamp. Also did some basic javascript. 

**Thoughts** turns out wasted the last 2 days for nothing, the problem is with codepen, I hosted the same code on a server and it works fine the only thing that doesn't work is the fixed nav on the top. Also did basic java script.

### Day 10: January 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: started with the free code camp javascript tutorial and made a simple page to paratice those functions. 

**Thoughts** its much much harder than i thought it will be to set up a html page which calls all the javascript functions. Still struggling with the call process, tomorrow is a new day so maybe tomorrow.
